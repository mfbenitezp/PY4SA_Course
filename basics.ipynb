I then create a new variable *b* and assign it to be equal to *a*. I then edit variable *a* by appending a new value to the list (we will discuss how this is done later, so don't worry if you don't understand how this works yet). When I print *a* and *b*, you can see that both variables contain the same set of numbers in the list even though I added 8 to *a* after setting *b* equal to *a*. Or, the change that I made to *a* was also applied to *b*. \n",
