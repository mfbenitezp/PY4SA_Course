    "We will now discuss additional components of the Python language including **functions**, **flow control**, **loops**, **modules**, and **reading/writing** data from disk. It is important you learn effective ways to make your code efficient, as python can be memory-consuming, but at the same time learn how to create Loops, and flow control will help to run tasks in an automatic ways making your scripts a powerful tool. \n",

    "If you have some experience with this type of conditions or components from your previous courses with R, you will see that the logic is the same. Reading and writing files using python is also a key skill to learn, as in most of the cases you will need to access files, or folders where your spatial data is located. \n",

    "Functions are probably one of the key components in any programming language, **Functions** do something when called. You can think of those as tools. **Methods**, which we will discuss in more detail later in this notebook, are like functions except that they are tied to a specific **object**. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a new **class**, you can define methods specific to the new class. Functions generally have the following generic syntax:\n",

    "output = function(Parameter1, Parameter2). #Think of parameters as Inputs., so you have output = function(Input1, Input2)\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, You are generating a simple function that multiplies two numbers together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *def* keyword is used when defining a function. Within the parenthesis, a list of **parameters**, which are often specific inputs or required settings, can be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the below example, the function accepts two parameters: *a* and *b*. On the next line, indented, and after the colon, what the function does is defined. In this case, the function simply returns the product of the two values. The **return** keyword is used to define the output of the function (or what is returned), in this case the product of the two provided values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a function is created, it can be used. In **Example 1**, You will see two **arguments**, or values assigned to the parameters, and save the result to a variable *x*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then when using a function, it is also possible to provide the arguments as *key* and *value* pairs, as in **Example 2**. \n",
