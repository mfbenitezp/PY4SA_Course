On the next line, indented, and after the colon, what the function does is defined. In this case, the function simply returns the product of the two values. The **return** keyword is used to define the output of the function (or what is returned), in this case the product of the two provided values.\n",

    "I briefly mentioned **classes** in the last module. Here, I would like to provide a more in-depth discussion. Since Python is an object-based language, it is important to be able to define different types of objects. Classes serve as blueprints for creating new types of objects. Thus, the concept, use, and application of classes is very important in Python. \n",

    "To create a new class, you must use the *class* keyword. Here, I am generating a new class called *Course*. To construct a class, you must use the *\\_\\_init\\_\\_()* function. Within this function, you can assign values to object properties, and *\\_\\_init\\_\\_()*  will be executed any time a new instance of the class is created. When I create an instance of my *Course* class, three properties will be initiated: the subject code, course number, and course name. *self* references the current instance of the class. Although you can use a term other than *self*, *self* is the standard term used. Regardless of the term used, it must be the first parameter in *\\_\\_init\\_\\_()*. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the *\\_\\_init\\_\\_()* function, I then define a **method** that will be associated with the class. This method, *printCourse()*, will print the course name. Again, methods are functions that are associated with an object or class. In order to use the method, I must first create an instance of the class and provide arguments for the required parameters. I can then apply the method to the instance to print the course info. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once an instance of a class is created, the arguments assigned to properties can be changed using the following generic syntax: instance.property = new argument. Here, I am changing the *number* parameter of the *x* instance of the *Course* class to 350. I then use my *printCourse()* method again. "
