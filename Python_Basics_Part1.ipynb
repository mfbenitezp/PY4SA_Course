    "In the cell bellow, you will run small experiment that explains some important behavior of Python. You have defined a variable *a* that holds a **list** of three values. We will discuss **lists** later in this section. Now, you create a new variable *b* and assign it to be equal to *a*. Layer you edit the variable *a* by appending a new value to the list (You will see how this is done later, so don't worry if you don't understand how this works yet). When you print *a* and *b*, you can see that both variables contain the same set of numbers in the list even though you added 8 to *a* after setting *b* equal to *a*. Or, the change that you made to *a* was also applied to *b*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, certain types of objects, such as lists, are **mutable**. This means that it is possible to change the data stored in memory and referenced to the variable. When a mutable object is altered, all variables that point to it will reflect this change. What this means practically is that setting *b* equal to *a* results in *a* and *b* pointing to the same object or data in memory. So, changes to *a* or *b* will be reflected in both variables since the data being referenced by both have been updated. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have  experience in **R**, and I guess you do, you will see how Python is different, as in R, setting a variable equal to another variable would make a copy that was not linked and could be altered without changing the original variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether two variables reference the same object in memory, you can use the *is* keyword. if *True* is returned, then they reference the same object. You can also print the object ID, which represents the memory address for the object, using the *id()* function. Using both methods below, you can see that *a* and *b* reference the same object. "
